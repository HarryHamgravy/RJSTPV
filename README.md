Once upon a time in a land far away,    
Lived a brave knight with a heart of gold.    
His name was Sir Percival, a man of great valor,    
Who always stood tall and never grew old.   
He rode his trusty steed, a horse named Thunder,    
Through fields and forests and mountains high.    
He fought off dragons and vanquished evil knights,    
And never once did he utter a lie.    

One day, Sir Percival set out on a quest,   
To find the Holy Grail and end all strife.    
He rode for days, braving danger and death,   
And never once did he lose his life.    

At last he reached the Grail's hidden cave,     
Where it was guarded by a fearsome beast.   
But Sir Percival was not afraid,    
For he knew that honor and justice would never cease.

He drew his sword and charged at the beast,   
Swinging his blade with all of his might.   
The two battled fiercely, neither one giving in,    
But in the end, Sir Percival was the one to win.    

He claimed the Grail and held it high,    
As a symbol of his bravery and might.   
And the people of the land hailed him a hero,   
For bringing peace and ending the night.    

Sir Percival returned home with the Grail,    
Where he was greeted by friends and family.   
He was hailed as a champion, a hero of the land,    
And his legacy would never fade, not even when he was buried in the sand.   

And so the brave knight lived out his days,   
With the memory of his great deeds never far away.    
He may have left this world, but his legend lived on,   
As a reminder of the power of good in a world that often seems so wrong.
